# PMI_Spark
> This is a Spark version of Pointwise mutual information

Usage
=============

1. Run `sh PMI_Spark.sh <INPUT_FILE_PATH> <OUTPUT_FILE_PATH>`.
:::info
In the code, you can choose to save the OutputFile in HDFS or write a file. But writing file directly will be slow and can't handle large file.
